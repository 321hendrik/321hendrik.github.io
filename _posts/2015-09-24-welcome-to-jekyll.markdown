This is about putting my daily experiences and code snippets in a centralized space and at the same time trying out a github hosted blog with [Jekyll][jekyll].
Hosting a blog this way is easy:

1. Create a github repo with your account name in the form of `username.github.io`
1. Install [Jekyll][jekyll]
{% highlight bash %}
gem install jekyll
jekyll new SITENAME
cd SITENAME
jekyll server
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
