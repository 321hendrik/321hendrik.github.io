You can create GUI tests with [SikuliX](http://sikulix.com/) in a blink.  
There is a default IDE, but if you want to write python tests for SikuliX in your favorite editor, here is my Sublime Text package.  
  
To activate it, follow the instructions on the [SikuliTools Project Page](https://github.com/hendrikelsner/SikuliTools).

Currently the SikuliTools support capturing a selection from the screen, saving it to the currently active directory and inserting the filename at the cursor position.
