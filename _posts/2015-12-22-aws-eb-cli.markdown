Get ready using AWS Elastic Beanstalk by installing the CLI and upgrading your git workflow.
This is how you do it:

* check that python is installed (install it from [python.org][python_install])
{% highlight bash %}
python --version
{% endhighlight %}
* install pip for easy module installation with python [here's how][pip_install]
* install virtualenv to have your eb-cli install isolated
{% highlight bash %}
(sudo) pip install virtualenv
{% endhighlight %}
* finally install eb-cli
{% highlight bash %}
# create a new virtual environment for eb-cli
virtualenv ~/ebenv
# change into the new environment
source ~/ebenv/bin/activate
# install eb-cli
pip install awsebcli
# leave the environment
deactivate
# link the cli for path access
sudo ln -s ~/ebenv/bin/eb /usr/local/bin/
{% endhighlight %}
* check that everything installed fine
{% highlight bash %}
eb --version
{% endhighlight %}

Now that you're ready to go, change into a git repository and initialize EB:
{% highlight bash %}
eb init
{% endhighlight %}
checkout your production branch and link it to an EB environment (list them with `eb list`):
{% highlight bash %}
git checkout production
eb use my_app_production
{% endhighlight %}
now you can deploy changes, check status, get logs and much more:
{% highlight bash %}
eb deploy
eb status
eb logs
...
{% endhighlight %}

You can find out more about the EB-CLI [here][eb_cli_commands].
