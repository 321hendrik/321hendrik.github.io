Get ready using AWS Elastic Beanstalk by installing the CLI and upgrading your git workflow.

### Installation

This is how you do it:

* check that python is installed (install it from [python.org][python_install])

```bash
python --version
```

* install pip for easy module installation with python ([here's how][pip_install])
* install virtualenv to have your eb-cli install isolated

```bash
(sudo) pip install virtualenv
```

* finally install eb-cli

```bash
# create a new virtual environment for eb-cli
virtualenv ~/ebenv
# change into the new environment
source ~/ebenv/bin/activate
# install eb-cli
pip install awsebcli
# leave the environment
deactivate
# link the cli for path access
sudo ln -s ~/ebenv/bin/eb /usr/local/bin/
```

* check that everything installed fine

```bash
eb --version
```

### Setup

Now that you're ready to go, change into a git repository and initialize EB:

```bash
eb init
```

* checkout your production branch and link it to an EB environment (list them with `eb list`):

```bash
git checkout production
eb use my_app_production
```

now you can deploy changes, check status, get logs and much more:

```bash
eb deploy
eb status
eb logs
...
```

You can find out more about the EB-CLI [here][eb_cli_commands].
